    * ## Agile Methodology
        * This project was created using the agile methodology and github issues.

    * ## Entity Relationship Model
        * before i started this project, I created a relationship entity for a Django apps, which helped me determine that what models fields are needed for this project.

    * ## Flowchart
        * A flowchart was created to illustrate how different users can access my website. for example, if users are logged in, they can access a form and make appointments, while if they are not logged in, they cannot make appointments. They will be asked to login/sign up. 

    * ## Color Scheme
        * Using Google, I searched what colors are best for the dentist's website that is user-friendly, and I decided to go for blueish and greenish tones.

    * ## Fonts Used
        * ### To make the website stand out for a users experience, multiple fonts were used:
            * 'Oswald', sans-serif
            * 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif
            * 'Telex', sans-serif
            * 'Dangrek', cursive
            * 'Roboto', sans-serif
